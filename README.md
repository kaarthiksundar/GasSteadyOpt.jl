# GasSteadyOpt.jl 

This package implements algorithms to solve steady-state operational optimization problems on natural gas pipeline networks with ideal and non-ideal equations of state.
``GasSteadyOpt.jl`` is not a registered Julia package. Hence installation of the package should be done as follows:

```julia 
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/kaarthiksundar/GasSteadyOpt.jl.git")
```

For the API usage, users are referred to the ``test/`` and the ``examples/`` directories.
